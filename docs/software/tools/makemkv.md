# MakeMKV

Use [MakeMKV](https://flathub.org/apps/com/makemkv/MakeMKV) to extract the DVD into MKV files.

> If you need a license key navigate to (https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1053)

Find which titles are the main title and extras you want (https://www.dvdcompare.net) can be useful for finding lengths of extras.

Then extract all of them to a folder.

## Manual Mode

For certain media the playlist can confuse MakeMKV, if this happens.

  * Open the DVD in VLC and note the track number of the title
  * Enable Expert mode in MakeMKV settings
  * Tick `Open DVD Manually` before scanning the disc
  * Type the number of the track to rip
